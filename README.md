# LR vs KNN

The 'Sonar data' file consists of a bunch of unlabeled data that give an outcome of either
 'R' for Rock, 
 'M' for Mine

I applied Logistic regression and KNN to the dataset,
to determine if a detected object is a rock or mine.


The Logistic Regression had the following results:
Training data accuracy of 83.4%, 
Test data accuracy of 76.2%

The KNeighbours Classifier had the following results:
Training data accuracy of 100% (yes you read that right), 
Test data accuracy of 95.3% 

The KNN Classifier is the better model for this data
I mean it's quite obvious, it's in the name lol.
